<h1 align="center">Team salaries</h3> 
This project will make it possible to obtain the salary budget in general and by specialization categories.
In the "Salaries" form, you need to enter specialization, salary and tax. Upon confirmation, data from the form is read and displayed in the DOM in the form of a list. Identical elements are not added. When trying to add the same items, an error message is displayed that ticks after 3 seconds. The entered data is transferred to the corresponding functions for calculation. In the "Team" form, user actions and feedback about them are similar.
At the moment, all functions conceived for the development have been implemented.
Perhaps, in the future, the project will change and be supplemented.
